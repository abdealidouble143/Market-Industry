Electronic skin, often referred to as e-skin, is a cutting-edge innovation in wearable technology that mimics the sensory and responsive functionalities of human or animal skin. It comprises flexible, stretchable, and sometimes self-healing electronic components that can detect external stimuli such as pressure, temperature, and humidity. These devices are typically built using advanced materials such as organic electronics, graphene, and flexible polymers that allow them to conform to the contours of various surfaces, making them ideal for integration into wearables, robotics, and prosthetics.



The primary applications of electronic skin span across healthcare monitoring, robotics, and prosthetic enhancements. For instance, in healthcare, e-skin can be embedded into wearable devices to track vitals like heart rate, hydration, and body temperature in real-time. In robotics, it enables machines to gain a sense of touch, enhancing their interaction with the environment. For prosthetics, it offers the possibility of restoring tactile sensations for amputees, representing a significant breakthrough in neuroprosthetics.
