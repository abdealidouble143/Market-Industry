Electronic Glue Guns—also known as electric or hot glue guns—are handheld devices designed for the precise and efficient application of hot melt adhesives. Typically powered by electricity, these tools heat solid glue sticks until they become viscous, allowing the adhesive to be dispensed through a trigger mechanism. Due to their convenience and versatility, electronic glue guns are widely used across various industries including arts and crafts, electronics, automotive repairs, and packaging.



The device's design supports rapid heating, temperature control, and continuous glue flow, making it superior to manual alternatives. Advanced versions now come with digital temperature regulation, cordless operation, and compatibility with a wide range of adhesive types.
