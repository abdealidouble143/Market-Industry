An electronic fuse (e-fuse) is a vital protective device in electronic circuits, designed to limit current and isolate fault conditions by interrupting power flow. Unlike traditional mechanical fuses, electronic fuses utilize semiconductor technology to provide accurate, resettable protection. They help safeguard sensitive electronic components by actively responding to overcurrent, overvoltage, and short circuit events. Widely integrated into consumer electronics, industrial automation systems, automotive electronics, and manufacturing devices, e-fuses are essential for enhancing system reliability and safety.



E-fuses offer advantages like fast response time, reusability (unlike conventional single-use fuses), programmability, and integration into compact designs. As electronic systems become increasingly miniaturized and sophisticated, the demand for e-fuses continues to grow, driven by the need for intelligent protection mechanisms.
