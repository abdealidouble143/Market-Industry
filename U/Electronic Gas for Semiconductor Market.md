Electronic Gas for Semiconductor refers to highly purified gases used throughout semiconductor manufacturing processes such as doping, etching, cleaning, and film deposition. These gases are integral in creating the micro and nano-scale features of semiconductors used in integrated circuits, flat-panel displays, solar photovoltaic cells, and LED technologies. Electronic gases are often categorized into specialty gases (used in low volumes with high purity) and bulk gases (used in larger quantities). Given their extensive use and importance, they are commonly referred to as the "food" of the semiconductor industry.



These gases must meet stringent quality standards to prevent contamination in high-precision processes. Examples include silane (SiH4), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H2), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), and carbon tetrafluoride (CF4), among others. The demand for these gases grows proportionally with the expansion of advanced semiconductor manufacturing.
